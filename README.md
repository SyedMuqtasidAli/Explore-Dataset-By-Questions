## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `students_data.csv`. It consists of 300 observations with the following columns:
- **name**: Name of the student
- **university**: University attended by the student
- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average of the student

## ❓ Questions
Here are 20 data science questions that you can explore using your dataset:
1. What is the average CGPA of the students?
2. How many students are from each university?
3. What is the highest CGPA in the dataset?
4. What is the lowest CGPA in the dataset?
5. How many students have a CGPA greater than 3.5?
6. How many students have a CGPA less than 2.0?
7. What is the most common CGPA in the dataset?
8. Which university has the highest average CGPA?
9. Which university has the lowest average CGPA?
10. How many students have a CGPA of exactly 4.0?
11. What is the median CGPA of the students?
12. What is the mode of the CGPA in the dataset?
13. How many unique universities are there in the dataset?
14. What percentage of students have a CGPA above 3.0?
15. What percentage of students have a CGPA below 2.5?
16. What is the distribution of CGPAs among students from different universities?
17. Are there any missing values in the dataset?
18. What is the standard deviation of the CGPA?
19. How many students have a CGPA between 2.5 and 3.0?
20. Which student has the highest CGPA, and which university do they attend?
